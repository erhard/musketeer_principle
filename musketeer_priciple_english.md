the musketeer principle

the musketeer principle is a principle for coping with small and large projects
It is the basis of cooperation in teams. a rogue who transfers this thought to a society ;-)

- no room for egoists and "not teamplayer"
- all for one one for all.
- do not embarrass.
- do not know either.
- Everyone helps everyone and can also receive help
- Help must be accepted
- basic features is openness tolerance and acceptance
- the group helps each individual to develop.
- in a group, there may be different roles depending on the gusto and needs
- goals are common goals
- but everyone can have a "home". All help to preserve or restore another's home
- this is another property to compromise. because the goals and home are often competing
